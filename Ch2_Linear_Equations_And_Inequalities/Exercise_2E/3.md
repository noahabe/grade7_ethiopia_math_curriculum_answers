> Find the two smallest consecutive even integers whose sum is at least $51$. 

--------------------------------

Let $n$ be the first of such integer. Then the other one is $n+2$. 

Then, 

$
n + (n+2) \geq 51
$

$
\Rightarrow 2n + 2 \geq 51
$

$
\Rightarrow 2n \geq 49
$

$
\Rightarrow n \geq \frac{49}{2} = 24.5
$

$n$ cannot be $25$ because $n$ needs to be even. Thus $n = 26$. And the other one is $n + 2 = 28$.
