--------------------------------

Recall the definition of perimeter:

$2(l + w) = 628$

$\Rightarrow l + w = 314 \quad \quad (1)$

Since the length of the field exceeds its width by $6$ m, we have: 

$
l = w + 6 \quad \quad (2)
$

put equation $(2)$ into $(1)$: 

$l + w = 314$

$\Rightarrow (w + 6) + w = 314$

$\Rightarrow 2w + 6 = 314$

$\Rightarrow 2w = 308$

$\Rightarrow w = 154$

Thus the width is $154$ meters.

And the length is $l = w + 6 = 154 + 6 = 160 \text {meters}$
