> A farmer has sheep and hen. The sheep and hen together have 100 heads and 
> 356 legs. How many sheep and hens does the farmer have? 

--------------------------------

Let $s$ denote the number of sheep the farmer has. 

Let $h$ denote the number of hens the farmer has. 

Since a sheep has only $1$ head (similarly for a hen), we have: 

$ 
s + h = 100
$

$ 
\Rightarrow s = 100 - h  \quad \quad (1)
$

Since a sheep has $4$ legs and a hen has $2$ legs, we have: 

$
4s + 2h = 356 \quad \quad (2)
$

Substituting equation $(1)$ into equation $(2)$, we have: 

$
4 (100 - h) + 2h = 356
$

$
\Rightarrow 400 - 4h + 2h = 356
$

$
\Rightarrow 400 - 2h = 356
$

$
\Rightarrow -2h = 356 - 400
$


$
\Rightarrow -2h = -44
$

$
\Rightarrow 2h = 44
$

$
\Rightarrow h = 22
$

Thus the number of hens is $22$.

Since we now know the number of hens, substituting this into equation $(1)$, the number
of sheep is $78$.
