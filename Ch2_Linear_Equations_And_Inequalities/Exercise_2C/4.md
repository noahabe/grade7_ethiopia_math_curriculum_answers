--------------------------------

Let $b$ denote the number of boys in the classroom. 
Let $g$ denote the number of girls in the classroom. 

Since there are 48 students in total, we have

$
b + g = 48 \quad \quad \text{(1)}
$

Since the number of girls is $3$ times the number of boys, we have

$
g = 3b \quad \quad \text{(2)}
$

Substituting equation $(2)$ into equation $(1)$, we get

$
b + 3b = 48
$

$
\Rightarrow 4b = 48 
$

$
\Rightarrow b = 12 
$

Therefore the number of boys is $12$. 

Since the number of girls is $3$ times the number of boys, the number of 
girls is $36$.
