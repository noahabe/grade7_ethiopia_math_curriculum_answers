--------------------------------

Let $x$ and $x+1$ be the consecutive integers we are looking for. 

Translating the question into an equation we get: 

$
(x) + (x+1) = 3 [ (x+1) - (x)]
$

$
\Rightarrow 2x + 1 = 3 
$

$
\Rightarrow 2x = 2
$

$
\Rightarrow x = 1
$

Since we are asked the larger number, our answer will be $2$.
