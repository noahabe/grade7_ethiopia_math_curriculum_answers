--------------------------------

Let $g$ denote the number of girls in the school and $b$ denote the 
number of boys. 

Since the number of girls exceeds the number of boys by $15 \%$, we have: 

$g = b + 15\% b$

$\Rightarrow g = b + \frac{15}{100} b$

$\Rightarrow g = \frac{100}{100}b + \frac{15}{100} b$

$\Rightarrow g = \frac{115}{100}b$

$\Rightarrow \frac{100}{115}g = b$

$\Rightarrow \frac{100}{115} = \frac{b}{g}$

$\Rightarrow \frac{20}{23} = \frac{b}{g}$

Thus, the ratio of the number of boys to girls is $b:g = 20:23$.
