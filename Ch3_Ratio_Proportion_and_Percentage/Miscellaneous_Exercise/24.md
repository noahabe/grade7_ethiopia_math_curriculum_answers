Let $g$ denote the number of girls in the classroom and $b$ denote the 
number of boys. 

Since the number of girls is $10$ greater than the number of boys we have: 

$g = 10 + b$

Since the ratio of the number of girls to the number of boys is $7:5$ we have: 

$\frac{g}{b} = \frac{7}{5}$

$\Rightarrow \frac{10 + b}{b} = \frac{7}{5}$

$\Rightarrow 5 (10 + b) = 7b$

$\Rightarrow 50 + 5b = 7b$

$\Rightarrow 50 = 7b - 5b$

$\Rightarrow 50 = 2b$

$\Rightarrow 25 = b$

Thus the number of boys is $25$. And the number of girls is $10$ more than 
that, which is $35$. 

And the total number of students is equal to 

$g + b = 35 + 25 = 60$
